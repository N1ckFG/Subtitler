I just want you to know
that I’ve been thinking a lot lately
and I think
that all of you people
are doing a really good job.
You’re really a—
you’re really a bunch of terrific people
you are, you’re really terrific.
I just want you to know that.
That’s all.

Hello again.
I’ve been thinking
a bit more, and
I want you all to know
just 
how 
really terrific you all are
each and every one of you.
I wanted to take the time out
to explain that
in this
manner
for all of you
to understand and appreciate
how really terrific you all are.

So
hello
I’ve been thinking a bit more
and I’ve been thinking about
Nazis.
I, I don’t like Nazis
I don’t think they’re 
terrific
I, I think they should be withdrawn
from the
the statement that I made previously
I mean, should not be included, like.
Not Nazis.  They’re not terrific.
And lately I’ve been
having serious reservations about
mujihadeen as well.
Ah, thank you
and goodnight.

Um, it’s—
it’s me again.
Uh, the man who 
The man who gave my grandmother
some bad medicine and it stopped 
her kidneys from working, I
I don’t like him.
Ah, no, do not like him either
I would like to withdraw him
from the statement that I made
no, he’s not, uh,
it was a lady doctor, she’s
she’s not a very nice person at all.
No she isn’t.
And she’s not terrific.
Thank you.

Hello, um
me again.
Hello, um
about what I said previously,
um
those two men
we’ve been seeing a lot of
on the television.
You know those two?
I don’t like them either, they
they frighten and depress me, and
and
no, they, they’re not—
they might be terrific people 
if you knew them socially
but—
I just don’t like them
and I’d like to withdraw them
from the statement that I made previously
ah, thank you.

Uh, me again, um.
I just want to say
the rest of you 
the rest of you who 
aren’t the people I mentioned, the
Nazis and so forth, and
you’re all really terrific people
and I do want to stress that one last time.
Thank you for your attention
and goodnight.
